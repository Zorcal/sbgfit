A fitness application focused on CrossFit and Hyrox training, with bodybuilding support.

## Core Principles

**Speed is the primary UX factor.** All feature development and decisions prioritize user-perceived speed and simplicity:

- **Simple, fast UX/UI** - Minimize friction in user interactions
- **Clean, performant code** - Optimize for speed in implementation and execution
- **CrossFit & Hyrox focused** - Primary training methodologies with bodybuilding as secondary support

When deciding on features, speed and simplicity guide all development choices.

## Development Guidelines

All Go development must follow guidelines in [`backend/AGENTS.md`](./backend/AGENTS.md).
